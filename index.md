            <p>Our model works really well with identifying nationalities, or religious or political groups. It needs improvement in identifying geopolitical enties, like cities, or countries. (This is the most common label for our entities). It did't work well with buildings, highways, bridges, airports, etc. because this type of data was rare. It we had more time, we would have made a model similar to spaCy's NLP model using Pytorch or Keras.</p>
